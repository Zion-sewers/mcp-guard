**Break your MCP servers before attackers do.**

Your MCP server exposes tools to any agent that connects. mcp-guard connects first, and attacks. It spawns your server over stdio, reads every tool's input schema, and fires schema-aware attack payloads at every parameter. Each response is classified: `SAFE`, `FINDING`, or `CRASH`.

Against Anthropic's official `server-memory`, a stock run produced **41 findings**, including critical shell-injection hits where `$(whoami)` returned a normal-looking empty response. Not a crash. A silent execution. That is the dangerous kind. Full receipts in [LEADERBOARD.md](LEADERBOARD.md).

## Watch it run

![mcp-guard fuzz demo](docs/demo.gif)

*Live capture: `mcp-guard fuzz` against a two-tool toy MCP server — 58 findings, 0 crashes, verdict in the table.*

## 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zion-sewers/mcp-guard && cd mcp-guard
pip install -e .
mcp-guard fuzz -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Zero runtime dependencies. Reports in `table`, `json`, or `sarif` for CI.

## What it does

- Six probe types: shell injection, SSRF, overflow, type confusion, prompt injection, indirect injection.
- Schema-aware payloads: it reads each tool's `inputSchema` and builds attacks that fit the declared types.
- Machine-readable output: `sarif` for code scanning dashboards, `json` for pipelines.

## Honest limits

- Stdio transport only. SSE and streamable HTTP are out of scope for v1.
- Findings are response-pattern classifications for investigation, not confirmed exploits.
- Not on PyPI yet. Install from source.
